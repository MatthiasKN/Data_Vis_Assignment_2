      <h2>Data Origin</h2>
      <p class="bioText">In producing this project, Roston and Migliozzi of Bloomberg used data from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). GISS contributed to a large international clime-science research effort called the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5. Phase 5 uses existing climate-science models that attempt to explain observed climate data, and to make projections for future climate scenarios. The models used incorporate estimates of climate ‘forcings’, external factors such as changes in the earth’s orbit or aerosol emissions, that influence global climate. These forcing estimates are not actual observed data but rather, are the averages of 5 model simulations for each forcing factor with different initial conditions.<br><br>Bloomberg’s visualization uses data on the 1880-1910 average temperature as a baseline. It then overlays data on observed temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2005 to show temperature trends over the past century, in BLACK. Finally, it overlays data drawn from models which estimate the impact of forcings on top of this observed temperature variation data in COLOUR to show the predicted impact of forcings lines up with observed temperature trends. The details of these models and the assumptions they make are laid out in this Miller et al. (2014) <link class="assignmentLink"><a href="https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2014/2014_Miller_mi08910y_corrected.pdf">paper</a>. The image below is an example of the type of data Roston and Migliozzi adapated.</p>

      <h2>Data Processing</h2>
      <p class="bioText">The authors of this visualization do not provide information on how they processed the data. We assume though, they converted the complex data provided in the GISS paper into 11 simple data sets,  for the various climate-influencing factor or combinations of factors. They then appear to have produced animated line charts using these basic data sets. Ultimately though, it seems that the authors did not substantially alter any data that they attained from GISS.<p>
