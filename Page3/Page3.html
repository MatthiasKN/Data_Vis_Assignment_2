      <h2>Project Perspective</h2>
      <p align="justify"> This project is not neutral, and is explicitely trying to advocate against the idea that climate change can be explained by factors other than human activity. In doing so, the project has a political element. In the US, climante change denial is typically associated with the political right, while climate change acceptance is associated with the political left. 

      <h2>Strengths & Weaknesses</h2>
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p class="bioText">The visualization exhibits a storyline that is easy to read and can be followed by the common reader. The data is exhibited in several stages, so as to not overwhelm the reader with a multitude of information all at once. The information is broadly broken down into natural and human factors, and then further divided into the different elements within these two factors that affect the climate. Thus, multiple layers can be viewed in the visualization to assess the impact of each individual element as well as the two factors broadly. Each external factor, or ‘forcing’ is represented by a unique color that allows the reader to distinguish between the forcings easily. Additionally, each slide in the graphic is accompanied with a short description to help the reader understand what is happening at each stage.</p>
     
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <h6>1. Data Selection & Presentation </h6>
      <p align="justify"> The project would benefit from having an introduction. It is unclear to the reader what exactly they should be looking for as several data sets are presented. It is also unclear how the authors selected their data from the much larger and more complicated GISS data source. Their methodological explanation does not sufficiently explain this process and here especially, a more informative introduction would be helpful</h6>

      <h6>2. Data Processing </h6>
      <p align="justify"> Throughout the visualization sequence, the authors provide several 'agglomeration images' in which multiple climate-influencing factors are displayed simultaneously and then averaged. How this average is produced is very unclear. It may be a conventional average, or may involve some form of weighting. The reader is simply left to absorb the intended message of these agglomoration images without fully understanding how the authors arrived at them</p>

      <h6>3. Navigation </h6>
      <p align="justify"> Although the image progression and animation is fairly smooth, navigating forward and backward through all of the sequential images is not easy. The authors have provided a basic navigation system in the form of linked bubbles to the side of the chart animations but When the initial animation is in progress, the user cannot navigate to anywhere else in the site. Additionally, many of these navigation bubbles are deffective at certain points in the viewing progression and simply do not direct the user to the appropriate point in the visualization sequence.</p>
