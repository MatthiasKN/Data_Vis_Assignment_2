      <h2>Project Perspective</h2>
      <p align="justify"> We identify three general limitations of this project:
     </div>
     <h3>1. Inconsistency between the message and the images </h3>
     <p align="justify"> As discussed before, this visualization uses line graphs with 95% confidence intervals to demonstrate that greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming. However, line graphs and simulations are normally not the typical method to show causality between two variables. We must recall that this type of graphs are useful when one is trying to study how two variables are related or vary with each other. In this sense, anyone who has taken a statistics class should remember that the fact that two trends fluctuate in tandem does not actually prove that they are related to each other. In other words, correlation does not imply causation.<br><br>In this case, we read in the first line the following: "causes to explain why the Earth has warmed", but we are faced with line charts simulating the effect of different variables on global temperature over time. However, at that point we do not know anything regarding the methodology (which is very important to know that this is actually proving causality) nor about the data that they used and how they processed it. Even though they later explain that they used very sophiscated methods to produce temperature simulations and show a causal relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, at first blush the receiver is deceive as the message and the images do not fully convey the intended message.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>2. Data presentation </h3>
      <p align="justify"> The project would definitely benefit to have some introduction or presentation guidelines. For instance, how to read the graphs, what are the data sources, and why we have to believe in the results from the model. The project starts with the graphs and then one need to scroll down to find the methodology (after landing in several pages), how to read the lines, and where does the data come from.
      </div>
      <h3>3. Conclusions can be misleading </h3>
      <p align="justify"> The project states that greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming. However, if one take a look at the graph of the ozone pollution or the sun's temperature, and using the 95% interval estimates, one could possibly believe that these variables can account for the planet's temperature. If we the take the upper bound of the intervals it is clear that until the late 1970s, global temperature was indeed related to ozone emmissions or sun's temperature. The only variable that shows that its confidence intervals are totally outside the range of possible values of the observed temperature is the aerosol emissions. Thus, in this manner, without any further clarification about the these points, the reader is forced to accept the conclusions.</p>

      <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
      <p class="bioText">The visualization exhibits a storyline that is easy to read and can be followed by the common reader. The data is exhibited in several stages, so as to not overwhelm the reader with a multitude of information all at once. The information is broadly broken down into natural and human factors, and then further divided into the different elements within these two factors that affect the climate. Thus, multiple layers can be viewed in the visualization to assess the impact of each individual element as well as the two factors broadly. Each external factor, or ‘forcing’ is represented by a unique color that allows the reader to distinguish between the forcings easily. Additionally, each slide in the graphic is accompanied with a short description to help the reader understand what is happening at each stage.</p>
