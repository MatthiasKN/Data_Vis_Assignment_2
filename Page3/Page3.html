      <p class="bioText">The visualization exhibits a storyline that is easy to read and can be followed by the common reader. The data is exhibited in several stages, so as to not overwhelm the reader with a multitude of information all at once. The information is broadly broken down into natural and human factors, and then further divided into the different elements within these two factors that affect the climate. Thus, multiple layers can be viewed in the visualization to assess the impact of each individual element as well as the two factors broadly. Each external factor, or ‘forcing’ is represented by a unique color that allows the reader to distinguish between the forcings easily. Additionally, each slide in the graphic is accompanied with a short description to help the reader understand what is happening at each stage.</p>
